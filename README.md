Code Snippet File Generator for Educators

There are lots of code snippet management tools for developers. This one is specifically for educators. I teach web classes and often need to give snippets to students to help them through a project, so that we can stay focused on the parts that are important. 

This project can be used to make snippets that students will copy and paste into a project. It includes an optional intro text area, and a caption for the snippets. The snippets themselves are line numbered and syntax highlighted using the google pretify library.

To get started with this project, you will need to download (or fork) it and create a database and import the included SQL file into it. There is a settings file you can use to set the name of the database and other settings you need. There is one user in the database. The login is Admin/password.
